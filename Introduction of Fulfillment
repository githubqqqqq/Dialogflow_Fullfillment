How fulfillment works:
You can enable fulfillment for any of your agent's intents. 
To use fulfillment, you need to set up a webhook. A webhook is a web server endpoint that you create and host.
--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
Webhook request
When an intent with fulfillment enabled is matched, Dialogflow will make an HTTP POST request to your webhook with a JSON 
object containing information about the matched intent.

After receiving a request, the webhook can perform any required tasks. For example, the webhook might use information from the 
request to look up a product in a database or place an order.

Finally, your webhook should respond back with instructions for what Dialogflow should do next.

Fulfillment is part of an Agent
To use Fulfillment, you need a webhook (web server endpoint)
To communicate, you need to send a request to the webhook
then webhook does the job you want it to do
and webhook returns the response
